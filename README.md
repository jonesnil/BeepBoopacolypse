# BeepBoopacolypse

This is the source code for my strategy game, Beep Boopacolypse.
Art/sound stuff was not made by me, the source for that will be
at the end of this, but the code was all written by me. You can 
play the game for free in your browser at this link:

And if you want to know what super talented people made the art/
sound that's all right here:
